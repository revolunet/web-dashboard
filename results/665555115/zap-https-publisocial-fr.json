The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.<\/p><p><\/p><p>CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:<\/p><p>    * The victim has an active session on the target site.<\/p><p>    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.<\/p><p>    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site.<\/p><p><\/p><p>CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered to disclose information by gaining access to the response.
